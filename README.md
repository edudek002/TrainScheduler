# TrainScheduler

This app allows the user to find the next train at CTA Randolph/Wabash station. Four buttons allow access to the CTA website.

There are four different lines that stop at Randolph/Wabash station: Pink, Green, Brown and Orange.

The lines have a different frequency depending on the time of the day, thus the user can enter 5 different segments: 
early morning, morning rush hour, mid-day, evening rush hour and late evening.
